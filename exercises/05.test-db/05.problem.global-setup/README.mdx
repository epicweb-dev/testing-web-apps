# Reusable Base Database

üßù‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Right now, our test setup involves a hard coded test database at
`prisma/test/data.db` which is created at the start and then deleted at the end
with the data reset between each test. This could be a big problem for other
tests that run in parallel and require the database. We need to make sure every
test that's running has its own database.

<callout-info className="aside">
	When we say "test" in this context, we mean "test files" rather than `test()`
	calls within a file. Test files run in separate processes with vitest, but
	each `test()` call runs in the same process as other `test()` calls in that
	file (because JavaScript is single threaded).
</callout-info>

Luckily for us, Vitest exposes a special environment variable to uniquely name
our databases per test process, so we can generate a unique database name for
each one. So we'll use that to create the database name to avoid these clashes.

We also have another thing that's been annoying and that is the fact that we
are running the migration script before each test. This adds a lot of time on
our test run, so we're also going to have a global setup file that handles
initializing a template database and we'll copy that one for each test (because
copying a file is much faster).

So in this exercise we'll be doing quite a few things at once, but doing them
separately would be even more confusing. Luckily we've got emoji friends to help
us out. You'll be creating two new files as well, so make sure to check the
Files button at the bottom of these instructions.

üí∞ Script to run for this exercise:

```sh
npm run test -- city-combobox
```
