# Data Cleanup

👨‍💼 Every time someone creates a new user with our `insertUser` utility, we're
making a change to the database that we should cleanup when we're finished.
So could you keep track of all those users and then use
[📜 `test.afterEach`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-after-each)
in our <InlineFile file="tests/playwright-utils.ts" /> to delete them?
