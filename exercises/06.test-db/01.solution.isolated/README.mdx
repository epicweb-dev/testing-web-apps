# Create Isolated Database

👨‍💼 Great job! You got that test passing.

🧝‍♂️ Yup! Not to be a downer, but it's a bit messy in that test file. I don't like
doing those dynamic imports and having to worry about import order all over the
place. Additionally it would be really annoying to have to do this for every
test file. Also, if we did have two tests doing this at once, they would mess
each other up because the test database filename is hardcoded. Let's deal with
these issues next.
