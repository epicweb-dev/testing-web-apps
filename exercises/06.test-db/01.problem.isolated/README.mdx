# Create Isolated Database

👨‍💼 We need to make sure our city combobox on the <LinkToApp to="/search" /> page
never breaks. So, we'd like to test it...

🧝‍♂️ I wrote a test
in <InlineFile file="app/routes/resources+/city-combobox.test.tsx" /> that
currently does not work.

The first time you run it, you'll get an error like this:

<callout-danger>
  `AssertionError: expected [ <li …(4)>…(1)</li>, …(19) ] to have a length of 1 but got 20`
</callout-danger>

And the second time you run it you'll get an error like this:

<callout-danger>
	`SqliteError: UNIQUE constraint failed: City.id`
</callout-danger>

This is because the test is running against the same database as the app which
we seeded a bunch of cities into. One of the first things the test does is
create cities in the database so the results can be deterministic. However, to
make this work, we need a unique and clean database for each test.

We're going to iterate to a global setup solution. To start though, let's just
get this test passing by itself. We need to make sure we set the proper
environment variables before importing
the <InlineFile file="app/utils/db.server.ts" /> file, otherwise our test will
connect to the wrong database, so this will involve moving some imports from
static imports at the top of the file to dynamic imports within our test.

Don't worry, we'll clean this up later.

We'll also need to run migrations on the test database we setup. We'll use the
[`execa`](https://npm.im/execa) package to do this.

Once the test is over, we'll just delete the temporary test database file.

We've got emoji friends to help us so go for it!

💰 Script to run for this exercise:

```sh
npm run test -- city-combobox
```
