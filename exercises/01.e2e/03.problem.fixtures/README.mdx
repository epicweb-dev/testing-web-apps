# Fixtures

When testing, you often need consistent data to work with. This is called a
["Test fixture"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture). Often, you really
do want to generate the data you're working with as it makes the test more
resilient to changes in the data and communicates intent better. That's the case
for everything we're doing currently so we're not going to use test fixtures
today (though Rocket Rental eventually uses one for testing photo upload).

However, we're going to (ab)use this concept to communicate between our tests
and our mocks.
