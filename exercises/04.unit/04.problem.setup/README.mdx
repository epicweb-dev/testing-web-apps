# AHA Testing

👨‍💼 Hey there! So Kellie added a bunch more tests, but she'd like you to clean
it up a bit. I'll hand you over to Kellie to explain.

🧝‍♂️ Yeah, so there's a lot of duplication and it's making it tough to know what
part of the test is important for the test's behavior and what is just setup.
So I want you to take a look at refactoring things a little bit to make it
easier to read and also easier to add more tests in the future if need be.
