# Test Isolation

👨‍💼 Super. Keeping these tests isolated in this way is often not an issue,
especially since our vitest test files are normally run in parallel in
completely different processes. But it's possible we may need to run them in the
same process to debug stuff in the future and if we didn't think about cleanup
now we'd be in trouble then.
