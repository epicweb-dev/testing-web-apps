# Remix Data Functions

👨‍💼 We have had some issues with images not getting deleted properly and it's
going to start filling up our database if we don't deal with it. 🧝‍♂️ Kellie has
already fixed the bug, but we'd like you to test the functionality.

You can find the code for this in <InlineFile file="app/routes/resources+/delete-image.tsx" />.
It's a fairly simple resource route with an action that handles authenticating
the request, checking that the request is valid, finding the image to delete,
and deleting it.

To get started, we just want you to write the happy-path test.

🧝‍♂️ I'll give you a hand, here's a simple example of testing a Remix loader:

```tsx filename=app/routes/projects.tsx
import { json, type DataFunctionArgs } from '@remix-run/node'
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import { db } from '~/utils/db.server'

export async function loader({ request }: DataFunctionArgs) {
	const projects = await db.getProjects()
	return json({ projects })
}

export default function Projects() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()

	return <ul>{/* ... */}</ul>
}
```

```ts filename=app/routes/projects.test.tsx
import { test } from 'vitest'
import { faker } from '@faker-js/faker'
import { db } from '~/utils/db.server'
import { loader } from './projects'

test('returns a list of projects', async () => {
	const projects = [
		{
			id: faker.datatype.uuid(),
			name: faker.lorem.words(),
			description: faker.lorem.paragraph(),
		},
		{
			id: faker.datatype.uuid(),
			name: faker.lorem.words(),
			description: faker.lorem.paragraph(),
		},
	]
	await db.createProjects(projects)

	const request = new Request('/projects', { method: 'GET' })
	const response = await loader({ request, params: {}, context: {} })

	expect(response.status).toBe(200)
	expect(await response.json()).toEqual({ projects })
})
```

The idea in this case is to put some test data in the database, then create a
request object, pass it to the loader, and assert on the response. That's pretty
much it.

It can be a bit more tricky if you're testing a Remix data function that
requires the request to be authenticated, but you can figure that out, I
promise. (💰 I'll help).

💰 Script to run for this exercise:

```sh
npm run test -- delete-image
```
