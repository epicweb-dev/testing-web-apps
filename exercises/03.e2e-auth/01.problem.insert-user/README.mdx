# Insert User

👨‍💼 Because we don't want to have to go through the onboarding flow for every
authenticated test, we're going to need an `insertUser` utility that allows our
tests to create and insert a new user in the database for us to reference in our
tests.

🧝‍♀️ I've added a few tests to <InlineFile file="tests/e2e/onboarding.test.ts" />
already. There's one for password reset and another for logging in as an
existing user. Those aren't quite authenticated tests, but your utility will be
useful to those as well.

And they aren't passing yet because they're using random users which do not
already exist in the database. So once you're finished making the utility
in <InlineFile file="tests/playwright-utils.ts" /> then please update those
tests to use your new utility. Thanks!

💰 Script to run for this exercise:

```sh
npm run test:e2e
```
