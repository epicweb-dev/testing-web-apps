# Unit Testing

Sometimes you have complicated utility functions that necessitate their own
test. This could be due to a few reasons:

- It's really complex and has many edge cases
- It's widely used and would therefore be disastrous if it broke

Let's take a password validation function as an example:

```ts
export function validatePassword(password: string): boolean {
	if (password.length < 8) {
		return false
	}

	if (!/[A-Z]/.test(password)) {
		return false
	}

	if (!/[a-z]/.test(password)) {
		return false
	}

	if (!/[0-9]/.test(password)) {
		return false
	}

	return true
}
```

We could definitely bring up the login form to test every edge case here, but
it would be more efficient to write smaller tests that focus on the
`validatePassword` function itself. For example:

```ts
import { expect, test } from 'vitest'
import { validatePassword } from './validatePassword'

test('returns false for passwords shorter than 8 characters', () => {
	expect(validatePassword('1234567')).toBe(false)
})

test('returns false for passwords without uppercase letters', () => {
	expect(validatePassword('12345678')).toBe(false)
})

test('returns false for passwords without lowercase letters', () => {
	expect(validatePassword('12345678')).toBe(false)
})

test('returns false for passwords without numbers', () => {
	expect(validatePassword('abcdefgh')).toBe(false)
})

test('returns true for valid passwords', () => {
	expect(validatePassword('12345678Aa')).toBe(true)
})
```

The neat thing about this is that the tests will run _much_ faster because they
don't each have to spawn an entire browser and load our app. And the lower level
testing tools also typically have a more powerful watch mode. Speaking of lower
level testing tools...

## Vitest

[Vitest](https://vitest.dev) is a testing framework modeled after the popular
[Jest](https://jestjs.io) testing framework. Both are terrific testing tools.
We're using Vitest in Rocket Rental.

The above example is a Vitest test and should be fairly familiar for anyone who
has written a test in JavaScript in the last half decade or more. I suggest
you keep [ðŸ“œ the Vitest API docs](https://vitest.dev/api/) open in a tab for
reference as you work through the exercises.

### Watch mode

Vitest's command line interface (a "CLI" is the thing you run in the terminal)
has a cool watch mode that will automatically re-run your tests when you save
your files.

## Remix

One of the neat things about Remix `action`s and `loader`s is that they accept
a standard `request` object and return a standard `response` object (though in
some cases they `throw` a `response` object). However, they are not typically
"pure" functions because they often perform fetch requests or communicate with
a database. So mocking HTTP requests or establishing a test database is often
necessary (we'll do that later).
