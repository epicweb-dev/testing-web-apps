# Cleanup

👨‍💼 Nice and clean ✨ Great work!

One problem we have with our approach is that if there's a test failure before
we get a chance to delete the user at the end, the user will remain in the
database. There are ways we could fix this (using `test.afterEach`), but it's
not that big of an issue so it's not worth the effort here. Feel free to try if
you like though 😉
