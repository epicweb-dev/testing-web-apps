# Login Page utility

👨‍💼 We can definitely make a utility function out of what you did, but we also
want to make a special kind of function that integrates nicely with Playwright.

Additionally, we want to make this function capable of generating the user in
the case that the test doesn't really care about the user, but just wants to
have one logged in. So we'll have you do a few things in this step of the
exercise, and when you're done, please use that utility in all the tests that
🧝‍♀️ Kellie added to <InlineFile file="tests/e2e/settings-profile.test.ts" />.
Some of these will generate their own user and others will use the one you
generate.

Your utility will need to go in <InlineFile file="tests/playwright-utils.ts" />
and you'll be using Playwright's [`test.extend`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-extend)
utility to add a `login` function. This will give you a special `test` and
`expect` object which we should use instead of the `@playwright/test` ones. So
you'll need to export those as well.

🐨 Don't worry, I'll be there to guide you step-by-step.

Don't forget the "Files" popup at the bottom of these instructions that will
show you all the files affected by this exercise.
