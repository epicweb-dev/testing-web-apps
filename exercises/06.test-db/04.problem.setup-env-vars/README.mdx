# Set Env Vars Early

🧝‍♂️ Our <InlineFile file="other/test-setup/setup-test-env.ts" line="34" /> file
is still doing that annoying dynamic `import()` and we have to be careful that
we don't `import` anything that requires these environment variables setup so
let's change things a bit to make that nicer next...

To do this, we'll create a new file
called <InlineFile file="other/test-setup/setup-env-vars.ts" /> and set the
environment variables in there, then we can add the import for that to the top
of our setup file and we'll be able to import anything else after that without
worrying about the environment variables not being set.

💰 Script to run for this exercise:

```sh
npm run test -- city-combobox
```
