# Delete All Data

🧝‍♂️ I've already written a handy function for you that handles deleting all the
data we need in our tests. You can read through it if you like
in <InlineFile file="other/test-setup/utils.ts" />, but it's unfortunately a
little complicated because we can't just reset the entire database. If we did,
we'd have to run migrations all over again. So instead, we query the database
for all the tables and ensure we drop data in the proper order to avoid
violating foreign key constraints.

All you need to do is call that `deleteAllData` function at the right point,
and you'll be set.

💰 Script to run for this exercise:

```sh
npm run test -- city-combobox
```
