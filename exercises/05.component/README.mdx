# Component Testing

As usual, when testing React components we want to focus on our two users:

1. The end user who's typing in the fields and clicking the buttons
2. The developer user who's rendering our component with props

We want to avoid a "third" user I call the
["Test User"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user) (as we've already
discussed). So we want to avoid mocking out React and other hooks if we can help
it. We'll do that by using the `render` function from `@testing-library/react`.

[`@testing-library/react`](https://testing-library.com/react)
(a library I wrote when preparing a workshop like this!!) is a set of utilities
that allow you to embrace our testing philosophy:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. - [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

So, if this is your first time using `@testing-library/react`, I recommend
having the documentation open and ready to reference as you go through this
and the next exercise (especially
[the page about queries](https://testing-library.com/docs/queries/about)). Much
of it will feel familiar to what we did in the Playwright exercises because
Playwright's queries were inspired by Testing Library's queries ðŸŽ‰.

Here's the simplest example of a test using Testing Library:

```tsx filename=app.test.tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'

function Counter() {
	const [count, setCount] = React.useState(0)
	const increment = () => setCount(c => c + 1)
	return <button onClick={increment}>Count: {count}</button>
}

test('counter increments when clicked', async () => {
	render(<Counter />)
	const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /count:/i })
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 0')
	await userEvent.click(button)
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 1')
})
```

If you've not used `@testing-library/react` before, I recommend you check out
[the Quick start Example in the docs](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/example-intro)
which should give you a pretty good idea of how to use it effectively.

If you've used Testing Library in the past, you may be interested in reading
[Common mistakes with React Testing Library](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/common-mistakes-with-react-testing-library)
as you may be making them yourself (don't feel bad, they're common ðŸ˜…).

## Remix

When our components are rendered, they are using a
[context provider](https://react.dev/learn/passing-data-deeply-with-context)
from Remix. When we try to render our components in our test, things like
`useLoaderData` and `<Link>` will expect to have that context available. The
tricky bit with Remix is that so much of what you're doing relies on the routing
layer which often involves loaders and actions.

So, the Remix team is working on a great solution for this called
`createRemixStub` which allows you to create a mini-Remix app that you can
render in your test and have all the routes you need for testing the component.
This is a work in progress, but should be released quite soon. As that is the
case, there is no documentation and the API we use has an `unstable_` prefix.
However, it's unlikely to experience many (or even any) breaking changes before
the release. Here are your "docs" for that:

```tsx filename=app/routes/counter.test.tsx
import { useLoaderData } from '@remix-run/react'
import { db } from 'utils/db.server'

export async function loader() {
	return json({ count: await db.getCount() })
}

export async function action() {
	await db.incrementCount()
	return redirect('/counter')
}

export default function Counter() {
	const data = useLoaderData<typeof loader>()
	return (
		<Form method="post">
			<button type="submit">Count: {data.count}</button>
		</Form>
	)
}
```

```tsx filename=app/counter.test.tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
import { json, redirect } from '@remix-run/node'
import { unstable_createRemixStub as createRemixStub } from '@remix-run/testing'
import Counter from './counter'

test('counter increments when clicked', async () => {
	let count = 0
	const App = createRemixStub([
		{
			path: '/counter',
			element: Counter,
			loader: () => json({ count }),
			action: () => {
				count = count + 1
				return redirect('/counter')
			},
		},
	])
	const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /count:/i })
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 0')
	await userEvent.click(button)
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 1')
})
```

It's pretty neat that we can test the UI component with some mocked backend
logic, however, I'm often interested in testing the component holistically, so
we can actually import and use the original `action` and `loader` from the route
as well:

```tsx filename=app/counter.test.tsx
import * as React from 'react'
import { render, screen } from '@testing-library/react'
import userEvent from '@testing-library/user-event'
// ðŸ‘‡ import the loader and action
import Counter, { loader, action } from './counter'
import { unstable_createRemixStub as createRemixStub } from '@remix-run/testing'

test('counter increments when clicked', async () => {
	const App = createRemixStub([
		{
			path: '/counter',
			element: Counter,
			// ðŸ‘‡ use the original loader and action
			loader,
			action,
		},
	])
	const button = screen.getByRole('button', { name: /count:/i })
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 0')
	await userEvent.click(button)
	expect(button).toHaveTextContent('Count: 1')
})
```

The trick here is to make sure you've got a database working in your test, which
we'll cover more in the next exercise.
