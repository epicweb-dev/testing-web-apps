# End to End Test

Whether you know it or not, you are already testing your application. Whenever
run your app after making a change, you are testing it. For example:

- You change the color of a button, you run the app, you see if the button is
  the new color.
- You change the checkout flow, run the app, and see if the checkout flow is
  the new one.

We call this **manual testing** and it works well when you're just getting
started with a project or feature, but the problem is after a while you realize
that it's impossible ensure your app is working with every change you make.
Especially when you make a change that affects multiple parts of the app. In
fact, we often affect parts of the app with our changes without realizing it,
so even if you were to test every change, you would still miss things.

Whenever we run into manual processes in the tech world, we often find it is
more fun (and efficient/profitable) to write software that automates the
process. What if instead of clicking around the app to test it, we could
write a little script that does this for us. Then when we make a change, we
simply run the script and it will tell us if the app is working or not.

I like to think of these scripts as "thousands of little Kent's" running around
checking that I didn't break anything. That's the beauty of software development
in a nutshell.

One challenge with automating any process is ensuring that you are actually
automating the process or improving upon it. Normally this isn't too big of a
problem, but in the testing world, it's actually a bit of a challenge:

<callout-warning>
	You're using a computer program to make certain that a human can use your app.
</callout-warning>

You're not trying to make sure that the **computer** can use your app, but a
human, but you're using a computer to do it. You will find yourself fighting
against this reality constantly as you write automated tests.

So, whenever you're trying to decide how to write a test, take a step back and
think how you would do it if you were giving a list of instructions to a human
tester instead of a script to a computer. Remember:

> The more your tests resemble the way your software is used, the more confidence they can give you. - [@kentcdodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds/status/977018512689455106)

And confidence is what we're going for when we're writing tests. Also, it's
important to know who is _using_ your software (and who is not) so you know how
they use it. For more on this, read
["Avoid the Test User"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/avoid-the-test-user).

## What is a Test?

<callout-success>
	A test is code that throws an error when something is wrong.
</callout-success>

For example:

```ts
// here's the thing we want to test ðŸ‘‡
const sum = (a, b) => a + b

// here's the test ðŸ‘‡
const expected = 3
const actual = sum(1, 2)
if (actual !== expected) {
	throw new Error(`The sum was ${actual} but it should have been ${expected}`)
}
```

That's it. That's a test. Modern testing frameworks do a lot to make writing and
running tests easier, but that's the gist of it.

## What is End to End Testing?

There are various tools and strategies for testing your application. Each has
their own benefits and drawbacks. We're going to start with the End to End
testing strategy because it does the best job representing how your app is
actually used.

"End to End" is referring to the fact that we're testing the app from the
user's experience all the way to our backend components. If you're just getting
started with testing, it may feel obvious, but there are lower level tests where
you often test individual components or even make fake versions of things. We'll
discuss these in more detail later.

<callout-success>
	Think about the way you're current manually testing your app. An "End to End
	test" is just doing that with an automation tool.
</callout-success>

## Playwright

We'll use a testing tool called [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/) to write
our tests. Playwright is a browser automation framework that allows you control
the browser and interact with it in ways that are very similar to your users.

[The Playwright Docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/intro) do a good job
demonstrating how to get started with Playwright. Most of the time you spend
with playwright will be in writing tests, so I suggest you familiarize yourself
with the [writing tests](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests) docs page.

Here's an example from the playwright docs:

```ts
import { test, expect } from '@playwright/test'

test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
	await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/')

	// Expect a title "to contain" a substring.
	await expect(page).toHaveTitle(/Playwright/)
})

test('get started link', async ({ page }) => {
	await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/')

	// Click the get started link.
	await page.getByRole('link', { name: 'Get started' }).click()

	// Expects the URL to contain intro.
	await expect(page).toHaveURL(/.*intro/)
})
```

A few important notes about that test:

1. `page.goto` is like the user entering a URL in the address bar and hitting
   "enter". Because often we want to test our app, we can skip the full URL and
   just provide a pathname by configuring a
   [`baseURL`](https://playwright.dev/docs/test-webserver#adding-a-baseurl) in
   the playwright config. With that setup, you can simply do `page.goto('/')` to
   go to the root of your app.
2. `page.getByRole` is called a [locator](https://playwright.dev/docs/locators).
   It's your primary mechanism for finding elements on the page to interact
   with. Playwright has several queries/locator functions, and many are based on
   [Testing Library](https://testing-library.com/)
   (by [me](https://kentcdodds.com) ðŸ‘‹).
   ["Roles"](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Roles)
   are a built-in feature of the browser used primarily by assistive
   technologies. By querying using roles, you're also testing a **part** of your
   application's accessibility to people using these technologies.

### Playwright UI

Playwright has a really handy feature called
[UI Mode](https://playwright.dev/docs/release-notes#introducing-ui-mode-preview)
which allows you to see what Playwright is doing in the browser and review each
step of the test. You'll want to spend a little bit of time getting familiar
with the features of UI mode.
