# Setup Function

üßù‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è We've got a lot of duplication in our code now and I'd like you to think
about how we can thoughtfully reduce that duplication to make it easier to make
new tests and maintain the existing ones.

Make sure to follow the advise in Kent's article
["AHA Testing"](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/aha-testing) to help you think about
how to refactor the code. The primary duplication is in getting thing setup
so I'd like you to look at creating a `setup` function that you can call in each
test. Just make sure to put only what's necessary in there and return only what
the tests all need.

We've got our emoji friends in there to guide you so let's get to it.
