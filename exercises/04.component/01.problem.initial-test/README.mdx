# Initial Component Test

👨‍💼 Our renter and host profile pages use a shared component called
`UserProfileBasicInfo` and that includes a fair bit of complex logic around what
is displayed for the chat link. It all depends on whether the user's logged in,
if they're looking at their own profile or someone else's profile, and if a chat
already exists between the user they're looking at and themselves. Here are all
the test cases we need to write (eventually):

- Link to chat is a form if user is logged in, is not self, and no chat exists yet
- Link to chat is link to specific chat if logged in, not self, and there is a history
- Link to chat is link to all chats if viewing it myself
- Link to chat is links to login if user is not logged in

For this first bit, we'll just focus on the first case. 🧝‍♀️ Kellie already created
the file for you and you've got a bunch of comments in there from our friends,
so let's get started!

It my be handy for you to check out where this component is used in the app,
you'll find it in <InlineFile file="app/routes/users_+/$username.host.tsx" line="173" />
and in <InlineFile file="app/routes/users_+/$username.renter.tsx" line="118" />.

In our test, we'll be focusing in on the chat link, so you can feel free to pass
fake data to the component for most of the props and we'll even make a fake user
for the user prop so we can easily test the logic around that.

💰 Script to run for this exercise:

```sh
npm run test -- basic-info
```
