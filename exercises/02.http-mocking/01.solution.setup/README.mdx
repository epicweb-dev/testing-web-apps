# HTTP Mocks

👨‍💼 Great work! Now that we've got that wired up we can add HTTP interception for
anything and everything our backend needs to do.

🦉 MSW is capable of intercepting HTTP requests in the browser as well ("MSW"
stands for "Mock Service Worker" and originally was just for browser-based
mocking). We don't typically use it for that because it's best to have all
requests go through our own backend code instead.
