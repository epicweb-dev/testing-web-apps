# Setup Function

🧝‍♀️ Great work, I feel much better about this code now. I feel like it'll be
easier to read and write the tests now that we have a good abstraction for the
setup.

Let's just avoid piling too much into this one setup function in the future. If
we need to write a new test that doesn't quite fit the existing setup function
there's no reason to bend the setup function to fit it. Just write a new setup
function. It takes a lot of discipline to keep these things wrangled, but that's
the job!
