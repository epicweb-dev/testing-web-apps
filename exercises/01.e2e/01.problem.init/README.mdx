# First Playwright Test

👨‍💼 We've got a great application, but as it's been growing we've been shipping
more bugs. I'm not pointing fingers. The team has agreed that adding some basic
tests would help us ship faster and more confidently, so we've asked you to
write up our first test.

The Playwright testing framework has already been configured for us in <InlineFile file="playwright.config.ts" />
and we've got a script you can run to start the tests in UI Mode:

```sh
npm run test:e2e
```

We want to test our onboarding process (it's one of the most important parts of
our app, so that's why we're giving it priority). Here are the current
instructions we have for the first part of our manual test:

1. Go to the homepage (<LinkToApp to="/" />)
2. Click the link that says <LinkToApp to="/login">Log in</LinkToApp>.
3. Verify the URL is <LinkToApp to="/login">`/login`</LinkToApp>.
4. Click the link that says <LinkToApp to="/signup">Create an account</LinkToApp>.
5. Verify the URL is <LinkToApp to="/signup">`/signup`</LinkToApp>.
6. Fill in the email field with a random email (💰 you can use [`faker`](https://fakerjs.dev/) if you like).

That's as far as we want you to go for this first test. Our tests go in the
`tests/e2e` directory. You'll start by creating a new file there called <InlineFile file="tests/e2e/onboarding.test.ts" />.

Once you've got that file created, go ahead and run the test script for E2E in UI Mode:

```sh
npm run test:e2e
```

If you'd rather simply run the test and get output in the terminal (without UI
mode), you can run:

```sh
npm run test:e2e:run
```

Good luck! 📜 Don't forget the [Playwright Docs](https://playwright.dev/docs/writing-tests).
