# HTTP Mocks

üë®‚Äçüíº Your co-worker added a tiny bit to the test you wrote. They added submitting
the form. You'll notice if you run the tests (`npm run test:e2e`), they fail.
This is because we've not gotten you set up to connect to our email service to
send email messages. Instead of giving you our private keys though, we're going
solve two problems at once.

Unfortunately, we pay actual money for every email we send through
[Mailgun](https://www.mailgun.com). We definitely do not want to send _real_
emails as a part of our automated test suite. In fact, it's been really annoying
to have to do that during development as well. So, instead of hitting Mailgun's
API to send an email, we're going to intercept that request during development
and testing to prevent it from actually sending an email and instead log the
email contents to the console.

ü¶â I've got some words about this...

<callout-danger>
	Whenever you make a fake version of something during testing, you're losing
	confidence!
</callout-danger>

Make certain there's a legitimate benefit for that cost of confidence. Making a
fake version of something in testing is called "mocking" and is often necessary,
but goes against the principle of ensuring your tests resemble the way the
software is used.

üë®‚Äçüíº Thanks Olivia... Back to the task! We have a number of things we need done.
We'll list them out here and go into detail below:

1. We've already installed [MSW](https://mswjs.io/), but it needs to be
   configured.
2. Enable the mocks when starting up the app.
3. Update our playwright config to use the new start script.

## 1. Configuring MSW

First, <InlineFile file="mocks/index.ts">Create `mocks/index.ts`</InlineFile>
and get MSW set up with this:

```ts filename=mocks/index.ts
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node'
import closeWithGrace from 'close-with-grace'

// TODO: add handlers here
const server = setupServer()

server.listen({ onUnhandledRequest: 'warn' })
console.info('üî∂ Mock server installed')

closeWithGrace(() => {
	server.close()
})
```

This is the basic start to configuring MSW. Next, we need to intercept requests
that are made to the Mailgun API. The URL for that can be
found in <InlineFile file="app/utils/email.server.ts" line="25" /> and is:
`https://api.mailgun.net/v3/:domain/messages`. So, we'll use `msw`'s `rest`
utility to intercept requests to that URL.

Another thing that's important when mocking is to ensure your mocked version is
as similar as reasonable to the real thing.
üìú [Here are the docs for the Mailgun sending API](https://documentation.mailgun.com/en/latest/api-sending.html).
The JSON response when an email is sent is something like this:

```json
{
	"message": "Queued. Thank you.",
	"id": "<20111114174239.25659.5817@samples.mailgun.org>"
}
```

üìú Here are the docs for some of MSW's utilities you'll be using with some
examples:

- [`rest`](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/rest) (üí∞ make sure you use `rest.post` and not `rest.get`)
- [`req`](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/request) (üí∞ you'll use `req.text()` + [new URLSearchParams](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/URLSearchParams/URLSearchParams))
- [`res`](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/response)
- [`ctx`](https://mswjs.io/docs/api/context) (üí∞ you'll use `ctx.json`)

üí∞ Note, you can just stick a rest call directly in the `setupServer` call if you like:

```ts
setupServer(
	rest.post('https://example.com', (req, res, ctx) => {
		// ...
	}),
)
```

<details>
<summary>#SpoilerAlert... Simple version of the MSW handler:</summary>

```ts filename=mocks/index.ts
import { rest } from 'msw'
const server = setupServer(
	rest.post(
		'https://api.mailgun.net/v3/:domain/messages',
		async (req, res, ctx) => {
			const body = Object.fromEntries(new URLSearchParams(await req.text()))
			console.info('üî∂ mocked email contents:', body)

			const randomId = '20210321210543.1.E01B8B612C44B41B'
			const id = `<${randomId}>@${req.params.domain}`
			return res(ctx.json({ id, message: 'Queued. Thank you.' }))
		},
	),
)
```

</details>

It's important to do some validation in the handler which can serve as
"assertions." For example, we can ensure that the required `Authorization`
header is present. And we can also ensure the request body is correct. Feel free
to add validation if you have the time.

## 2. Enable Mocks

Great, now we can enable the mocks when starting up the app. This will be done in two steps:

1. Setting the `MOCKS` environment variable
2. Importing the `mocks/index.ts` file

In the <InlineFile file="package.json" />, update the `dev:server` script to add
`cross-env MOCKS=true ` to the beginning of the command.
(üìú [cross-env](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cross-env)).

Now, open <InlineFile file="index.js" /> and conditionally require the `mocks`
file if the `MOCKS` environment variable is set:

```js filename=index.js
if (process.env.MOCKS === 'true') {
	require('./mocks')
}
```

Great! Now if you restart the server, the mocks log ("üî∂ Mock server installed")
should appear. This means we're ready to intercept requests.

We occasionally want to run the built server in production mode, but with mocks
enabled, so add this script to the `package.json` (üí∞ I stuck it below the
regular `start` script):

```json filename=package.json
{
	// ...
	"scripts": {
		// ...
		"start:mocks": "cross-env NODE_ENV=production MOCKS=true tsx ."
		// ...
	}
	// ...
}
```

## 3. Update our playwright config

Finally, when we run our tests on CI, we want to run the production server with
mocks, so we'll want to use the `start:mocks` script instead of the `start`
script like we're doing now.

Open <InlineFile file="playwright.config.ts" line="102" /> and update the `webServer`
where it's using the `start` script to use the `start:mocks` script instead.

## üéâ Congratulations!

Now you should be able to run the tests and they'll pass!

```sh
npm run test:e2e
```

When the test is finished, the application logs should log out the mocked email
message.

	<summary>Click here if you're not getting app logs</summary>

    <div style={{paddingLeft: 24, borderLeft: '1.5px solid #ddd'}}>
    If you aren't getting any logs for the application, it's possible you're
    not running the server and playwright separately. Playwright will run the server
    for you if it's not running already, but it swallows the logs. So you'll want to
    have the playground server running (which you can do in the app and then logs will
    appear in the terminal you're running the app in) and then run the tests in a different
    terminal.
