# Fixtures

🦉 When testing, you often need consistent data to work with. This is called a
["Test fixture"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test_fixture). Often, you really
do want to generate the data you're working with as it makes the test more
resilient to changes in the data and communicates intent better. That's the case
for everything we're doing currently so we're not going to use test fixtures
today (though Rocket Rental eventually uses one for testing photo upload).

However, we're going to (ab)use this concept to communicate between our tests
and our mocks. Because our tests are running in a separate process from our
application, we can't share data between the two processes (in fact, playwright
can be used to test any application in any language). So, instead, we'll have
our mock write a file in a "fixture" and then our test will read that file.

👨‍💼 Your co-worker added a handy utility file at <InlineFile file="mocks/utils.ts" />
which you can use to write and read a fixture. And because we'll be writing and
reading email fixtures so much, they made one specifically for that. It even
validates the data going in and out of the fixture for you.

You can use it like this:

```ts
await writeEmail(email)
```

This will write a file at `mocks/fixtures/email/{email.to}.json` with the
contents of the email. You can then read it back in your test like this:

```ts
const email = await readEmail('whoever@example.com')
```

So, in this step, we want you to update the MSW mock handler to write the email
and then update the test to read it and proceed with the onboarding flow.
