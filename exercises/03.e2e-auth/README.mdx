# E2E Authenticated

Honestly, end to end testing would be pretty simple if we didn't have to think
about user authentication. However, most apps we build have aspects of it that
require a specific user (and normally the most important parts of our app do),
so we do need to think about user authentication in our tests.

A pretty natural way to do this is to simply make a utility out of our
onboarding test and run that before every test that needs to have an
authenticated user. However, this leads to two problems:

1. Tests take however long onboarding takes + however long the test itself takes.
2. A failure in onboarding will cause all tests that depend on it to fail which
   can make debugging failures a bit more difficult.

We already know that onboarding is working (provided the onboarding test
passes), so it's just unnecessary work to run it before every test. Instead,
thanks to the fact that our tests are running in a node.js environment _and_ we
have access to all our application code, we can actually skip the onboarding
process and just create a user directly in the database. Then all we need to do
is simulate the same authentication process that we do in our app.

This is not exactly a "mock," but if you squint, it kinda could be. We're just
doing steps in our test that are impossible for users to do. And that would be
really bad if we didn't already verify that the user can do those steps
manually as well.

Because doing this is so common, we normally make a utility to do it for us.

In Playwright, you can definitely call functions in your test code. But there's
also a feature called "fixtures" (I know, it's a bit of an overloaded term) that
allows you to make utility functions that hook into the test. We'll be using
that capability to make our utility easy to use.
