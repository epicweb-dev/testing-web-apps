# Login Page

🧝‍♀️ I already wrote a test that needs an authenticated user
in <InlineFile file="tests/e2e/settings-profile.test.ts" />, but I didn't
finish. We still need to make sure the page is authenticated before the test can
run.

You can check <InlineFile file="app/utils/auth.server.ts" />
and <InlineFile file="app/utils/session.server.ts" /> to get an idea of how
authentication works in our app, but I'll just say that we use an HTTP-only,
signed cookie to store the user's ID and then use that to look up the user
who's making the request.

👨‍💼 So, all we need to do is simulate that same sort of thing using the Playwright
APIs. In fact, we can even use some of our own app's utilities to create the
cookie itself.

💰 Here's an example of using Playwright's `addCookies` api:

```ts
page.context().addCookies([
	{
		// the name of the cookie you want to set
		name: 'user-session-cookie-name',

		// or 'Strict' or 'None'
		sameSite: 'Lax',

		// or you can use the path and domain options
		url: 'http://localhost:3000/',

		// false if you need the browser JS to have access to the cookie
		httpOnly: true,

		// whether to allow the cookie to be sent over http or https only
		secure: process.env.NODE_ENV === 'production',

		// the actual value of the cookie
		value: _session,
	},
])
```

📜 Here are some useful docs:

- [`page.context()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-page#page-context) - Get the browser context
- [`addCookies()`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-add-cookies) - add cookies on the browser context

💰 Script to run for this exercise:

```sh
npm run test:e2e
```
