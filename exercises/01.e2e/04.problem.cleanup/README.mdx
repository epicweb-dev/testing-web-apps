# Cleanup

🦉 If you went to a restaurant and they put your food on the plate of the previous
customer, it doesn't matter how delicious the meal is, you would probably not
leave them very good reviews. The food may be good, but you can't tell that
because the dirty nature of the experience spoiled it.

When we run our tests, we very often make changes to the environment we're
testing in. In our case, we're creating a new user. When the environment is
shared between tests, we're kind of doing the same thing as that restaurant 🤮.
Other tests may be impacted by the mess we've made. Failures would be
intermittent and hard to debug.

Test isolation is a way to prevent this and therefore a fundamental testing
principle. There are a lot of layers to test isolation and we'll talk about
others in future exercises. In our case, we don't want to reset the database
every time we run our tests because that could be slow and since we're sharing
our development database with the tests that would be annoying as
well. Instead, we're going to just keep track of the data we create and delete
that data when we're done.

Luckily for us, our tests have access to the database, so we can do this in a
pretty straightforward way.

👨‍💼 Thanks Olivia! I'll take it from here. Normally you'll use hooks like
`test.beforeEach` and `test.afterAll` etc. to do setup/teardown for tests in
Playwright, however that wouldn't work too well for us since the test creates
the user to be deleted so instead, we'll just do this at the bottom of our test:

```ts
await prisma.user.delete({ where: { username } })
```

Go ahead and stick that in there (`prisma` comes from
`import { prisma } from '~/utils/db.server'`) and we should be good to go.

If you want to verify you've got it working correctly, you can check the
username of the user that's created in the test and make sure they don't appear
when you go to their user page: <LinkToApp to="/users/:username" />
