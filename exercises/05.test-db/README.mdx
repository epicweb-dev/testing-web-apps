# Test Database

Most of the application we build involve a database of some kind. How you handle
this in your testing depends largely on how you access your data. In this
application, we are using SQLite with Prisma and better-sqlite3. This means we
can very easily create a special instance of our database for testing purposes.

If you're using another database like Postgres then you can likely follow a
similar approach to what we're going to do. If you're accessing all your data
from APIs then you'll likely spend a lot more time mocking things out using
[MSW](https://mswjs.io/).

## Isolation

We've already discussed the importance of isolation, but at this level of
testing, things are a little different. In our end-to-end tests, we decided to
run our tests on the same database as our development server. This comes with
a number of nice benefits, but it also means we need to make sure we delete any
data we create to avoid polluting our database with tons of test data.

When we're using SQLite and at this level of testing though, it's actually a bit
easier because we can spin up and down a SQLite database pretty quickly. The
biggest trick is making sure we run the migrations on the database, but what we
can do is make a "template" empty database file where all the migrations have
already been applied and then make a copy of that file for each test.

<callout-warning className="aside">
	You may be wondering why we don't just use an in-memory database with sqlite.
	Unfortunately, [Prisma does not support that
	feature](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/issues/732) ðŸ˜¢ But that's actually
	ok because it means we can inspect the database after the test is done if we
	want.
</callout-warning>

With this in place, you may think we don't really need to worry as much about
removing old data because the file will get deleted when the test is done
anyway. However, it's still important to keep things clean between tests because
there are some situations where it may be worthwhile to run all our tests in
the same process (and therefore on the same database), and individual test files
can have multiple tests in them, all of which will hit the same database.

So while it may seem like test isolation isn't as much of a concern at this
level, it definitely still is. However it is quite a bit easier since we start
from a clean slate, we can just delete all the data in the database after each
test. No need to manually track the data we create.

## Setup

One important aspect of setting up a test database is you need to make sure your
environment is setup before your tests run. In Vitest, you do this using the
[`globalSetup`](https://vitest.dev/config/#globalsetup) configuration. We also
often need to have something run before/after each/all test which you can do
in the [`setupFiles`](https://vitest.dev/config/#setupfiles) configuration.

Most of the time, the connection string is controlled by an environment
variable. So that's one of the concerns we'll be working with a fair bit in this
exercise.

Often our database utilities initialize themselves as soon as they're imported.
This is why it's important to run our setup before running the tests. But it
will definitely be something you'll need to worry about in this exercise, so I
want to call out that in JavaScript **import order matters.** It doesn't always
make a difference, but the order in which you import things will affect the
order modules are evaluated. This is why we typically
[make our modules pure](https://kentcdodds.com/blog/pure-modules).

However, in the case of database connections it's just easier to initialize
things at import time so you'll want to be aware of that in this exercise. Just
remember:

```ts nocopy
import { one } from 'module-one'
import { two } from 'module-two'
```

Is different from:

```ts nocopy
import { two } from 'module-two'
import { one } from 'module-one'
```

And if you need to evaluate some code before a module is evaluated you have two options:

```ts nocopy
import { one } from 'module-one'

console.log('do stuff')

const { two } = await import('module-two')
```

Or:

```ts nocopy
import './do-stuff'
import { one } from 'module-one'
import { two } from 'module-two'
```

We'll be doing a bit of both in this exercise.
