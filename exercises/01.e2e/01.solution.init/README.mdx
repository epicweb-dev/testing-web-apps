# First Playwright Test

👨‍💼 Great job! Did you know, that single test has bought us an enormous amount of
confidence? Now, we can run it before any deploy and we know that our
application builds and runs successfully. Before this test, we had to do that
manually. What a pain!

If you'd like to see a situation where our test saves us, take this code:

```ts
app.use('/', (req, res, next) => {
	return res.redirect('https://youtu.be/dQw4w9WgXcQ')
})
```

And stick it in the <InlineFile file="server/index.ts" line="33" /> before the
Remix `createRequestHandler` middleware. Then try running the test again.

Now disgruntled employees can't cause major issues to our app so easily! 🕺
