# Test Isolation

👨‍💼 Our encryption function relies on an environment variable called
`ENCRYPTION_SECRET`. We want to make sure that this is set for our tests, but
we don't want to provide the real value. So let's set it to a fake value and
then make certain that we reset it back to the value it was before (to avoid
polluting the environment for other tests).

You'll need to use [📜 `beforeEach`](https://vitest.dev/api/#beforeeach) and
[📜 `afterEach`](https://vitest.dev/api/#aftereach) vitest hooks.

💰 Script to run for this exercise:

```sh
npm run test -- encryption
```
