# Playwright Fixture Utilities

👨‍💼 We can definitely make a utility function out of what you did–

🧝‍♂️ Actually... I already did! It's called `loginPage` and it even allows you to
login as a specific user or it'll create a new one for you, feel free to check
it out here in <InlineFile file="tests/playwright-utils.ts" line="43" />.

👨‍💼 Oh, great! Thanks Kellie! Now we also want to make a special kind of function
that integrates nicely with Playwright, so you can write a test like this:

```ts
test('Users can update their basic info', async ({ page, login }) => {
	await login()

	await page.goto('/settings/profile')

	// ... etc.
})
```

When you're done, please use that utility in all the tests that 🧝‍♀️ Kellie added
to <InlineFile file="tests/e2e/settings-profile.test.ts" />. Some of these will
generate their own user and others will use the one you generate.

Your utility will need to go in <InlineFile file="tests/playwright-utils.ts" />
and you'll be using Playwright's [`test.extend`](https://playwright.dev/docs/api/class-test#test-extend)
utility to add a `login` function. This will give you a special `test` and
`expect` object which we should use instead of the `@playwright/test` ones. So
you'll need to export those as well.

This is a bit of a funny API, here's an example of how you could use this API
to add a `logPageURL` function:

```ts
import { test as base, expect as baseExpect } from '@playwright/test'

export const test = base.extend<{
	logUrl: () => ReturnType<typeof logPageURL>
}>({
	logUrl: [
		({ page }, use) => {
			const logUrl = () => logPageURL(page)
			// the argument you pass to "use" is what will be passed to the test
			use(logUrl)
		},
		// this is how you configure your fixture. Doing "auto: true" means this
		// fixture will be automatically available to all tests
		{ auto: true },
	],
})

function logPageURL(page: Page) {
	console.log(page.url())
}

test('log page url', async ({ logUrl }) => {
	logUrl() // <-- that function is the one we pass to "use" above
	// ...
})
```
