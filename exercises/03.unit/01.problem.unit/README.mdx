# Unit Testing Encryption

👨‍💼 If <InlineFile file="app/utils/encryption.server.ts">our encryption utility</InlineFile>
broke for any reason, it would be devastating to our business. Users wouldn't be
able to login! So we want to write some comprehensive unit tests for our
`encrypt` and `decrypt` functions.

Here are some test titles to get you started:

- `encrypts and decrypts text correctly`
- `throws an error when trying to decrypt invalid text`
- `produces different encrypted text for the same input`

💰 Remember to check the "Files" popup below to create the test file automatically.
